**Computability and Functional Programming in Lisp**

This project investigates the principles of computability through functional programming, inspired by the foundational work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church. Using Lisp, a functional programming language, this project implements recursive and declarative logic to explore Turing-computable functions. The code demonstrates key operations across List, Set, and Math functions, including recursive list processing, set manipulation, and mathematical calculations (e.g., Fibonacci sequences).

Each function is designed within a purely functional paradigm, specifying what the function computes without relying on imperative constructs. This approach closely aligns with concepts in Turing-computable functions, providing a practical exploration of the Church-Turing thesis and illustrating how functional programming can model abstract computational processes.

To run this project you will need: 
abcl.jar (Armed Bear Common Lisp), a required JAR file for executing Lisp in a Java environment
bash command: java -jar abcl.jar 
Once ABCL is running, load the .lisp files and execute functions as needed.
